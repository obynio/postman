## Synopsis

**postman** is an Arduino-based project which alerts you via SMS when there is some mail in your postal mailbox. I was tired of having to check my mailbox every day and was interested by the challenge of a such project :)

## Prerequesties

In order to work, **postman** requires some basic electronic knowledge, an Arduino UNO and a [SIM900 GSM module](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/GPRS_Shield_V1.0)

## About sources

The assembly drawings are included in the repository as well as the sources for the Arduino.

And I see you coming guys, the project is under a gnu-gpl license, means that you must credit the original authors before using the sources.
